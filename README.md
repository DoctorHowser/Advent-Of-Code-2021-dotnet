# Advent-Of-Code-2021-dotnet
Working though the Advent with C# dotnet 6! 


## About
I'm an instructor at [Prime Digital Academy](primeacademy.io) and work mostly in javascript. 
We've added some C# dotnet to our curriculum and I want to get better at it. I'm attempting this years Advent of Code in C#, making mistakes and learning as I go.

## Thoughts
> Running thoughts about each day as needed

Day 3 was a BEAR. And not in a cuddly way. I struggled with binary strings, conversion, and LINQ

Day 4 I felt I did well. 2d Lists are ugly though.
